## Developing

This webapp reads from an elasticsearch instance, so first you have to install elasticsearch. There are a couple steps to take to get some data into it.

Then, load mongodb data into it.

Make sure you [enable dynamic scripting](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting.html#_enabling_dynamic_scripting).
